# Project: Business Analysis & Process Re-engineering (2019 - 2020)

## Overview
Led the project to support Proximity Financeâ€™s aim to increase the performance of business processes to be more efficient and resilient along with the digital transformation journey. I was given an opportunity to take over the role of acting as a lead in the project to re-engineer the entire business process.

## Key Achievements
- **Improved Efficiency**: Captured the inefficient steps in the old business processes and eliminated redundant tasks in the new workflows for different functional teams and loan origination processes. New processes reduced time by 20%.
- **Cost Reduced**: Eliminated unnecessary tasks, including in-person activities and paperwork, resulting in a 10% reduction in business costs.
- **Increased Customer Satisfaction**: Customers were pleased with the new processes in the loan origination scheme, as it eliminated the need for branch visits. Customer retention rates increased by 20%, and acquisition rates rose by 5%.
- **Simplified Workflows**: Business teams reported that the new processes were simpler than before, boosting their performance in day-to-day tasks.

## Challenges Faced
- **Lack of Contribution and Resistance to Change**: Initially, the business teams resisted the changes. This challenge was overcome by explaining how the changes would impact their workflows and the financial aspects of the business, emphasizing the sustainability of the movement.
- **Unclear Process Flows**: The business teams initially provided unclear process flows while identifying the existing business process flow for improvement.
- **Insufficient Resources**: Poor resourcing, including team members not actively participating in brainstorming sessions and delayed meetings, caused some project delays. However, the project was successfully delivered and achieved its defined goals.
- **Lack of Communication**: The business teams' initial lack of responsiveness caused some delays in the project.

This project exemplified my expertise in the areas of project management, business analysis, cross-functional team collaboration, operations management, and democratic leadership.
